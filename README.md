# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 :
Importing numpy
### Step 2: 
giving matrix as a input as array
### Step 3: 
using inv function getting the inverse of the matrix
### Step 4: 
printing the inverse of the matrix

## Program:
```py
# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
# Developed by: b.bharathraj
# Reference no: 22008848
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
b=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
```
## Output:
![inverse of a matrix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121490575/214905428-87d13c23-21aa-468e-b1fa-eae847412617.png)

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
